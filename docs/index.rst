slimWS Documentation
======================

WebSocket framework writtein in Python.<br>
Works standalone but is preferred as `@upgrader`[1]_.

Some of the features of slimWS are:

* **No external dependencies or installation requirements.** Runs without any external requirements or installation processes.

* **Single threaded.** slimWS takes advantage of `select.epoll()` *(`select.select` on Windows)* to achieve blazing speeds without threading the service.
